^ UE5 PROJECT FILE ^


QUIZ BELOW
Holy fuck man I'm struggling I'm like 3 levels deep on that and I got redo it as a whole as project so I get the point. I got a couple good random ass screens. 
I will have the the project file with some comments on this dev docBLAH BLAH blah some other stuff here and there but it's finally done. 

It honestly wouldn't hurt to go back through these courses and perfect 'em because I got the gist of this project but did some things differently
such as a default char instead of ball torque and I also did the level switching manually through Level BPs rather than just using an array

BUT I am getting better and as stated before "It honestly wouldn't hurt to go back through these courses and perfect 'em"
