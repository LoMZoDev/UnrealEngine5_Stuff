Yesterday I had given up on the project, albiet I was trying to
take it in my own direction and try to 'optimize' but hey maybe when
all the courses and I’m a super cool coder because this project took roughly 5+ hours
to do...Anyways lets focus on Marble Run Documentation


"By hijacking the camera control through LEVEL ON PLAY I can create a static scene"
"I didn't use "Engine" "Engine - Inputs" I used a level blueprint !

Find ^ that stuff here on MarbleRun LevelBluePrint:
https://blueprintue.com/blueprint/5ia92soc/


BIG Lesson Learned : Select things in the editor world and then 
going into a blueprint to create a reference to the object. Though this 
cannot be done for everything sometimes it's better to be all strucutal and make
various classes and such.

Yeah I didn’t comment these blueprints but I do have documentation
Git (here)
