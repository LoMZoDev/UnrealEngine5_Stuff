HERE ARE MY NOTES FROM DOING THE PROJECT :

>Remember to hit compile all the time
^It Will ensure things play nice 
^^across the whole game 

>State Machines can go within StateMachines

>I put an addational 30/35 trying to work on a crouch
^It's scuffed though, after 10min/15 I shoulda moved on
^^oh weell ; )

>Problem solving is part of being a programmer
^So when something of the course is outta date time 2 be resourceful
^^This is dangerous because it can slowly but surly get 1 off task

>Sometimes its best to go out of context and force it
^and sometimes is best to restart and follow the refference exactly
^^and once comfy go back through for custom impS.

>Did you know X is the foreward vector(red)
>damn bro I got diff sounds for drone hits u and u kill drone


>Optimize stuff for performance
^Overlap events for the drones only need to happen with the player

>Unlike marsMarine I pushed all the way through not skipping bits @ the end
^it's like lego's perservence till the end and getting the job done counts

>There can be a lot of stuff in game mode BP
>Multiple WBP's can be on the screen @ once

>This project has started to imporve how comfy
I feel casting / making BP's talk to eachother
