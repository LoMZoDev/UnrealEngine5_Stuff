IS THIS 2 HOUR COURSE WORTH YOUR TIME?
There are worse resources out there but there are better free ones out there too.
Enter "UNREAL SENSEI" https://www.youtube.com/c/UnrealSensei

Look Unreal Sensei's two free youtube videos are both 5hours long each and cover this better
Unreal Sensei's two free youtube videos are 10 hours of content

Prep for those 10hours by
Listening to this guy drone on about stuff  for less than two
preferbly on a faster speed, ideally 1.5/1.7 and slow dowing and following for some bits

Why did I not provide more resources than this short write up, a image and moments in a video?
Because the WHOLE LIGHTING SECTION IS DONE A SEPERATE FILE THAN the one done so far, smh.
