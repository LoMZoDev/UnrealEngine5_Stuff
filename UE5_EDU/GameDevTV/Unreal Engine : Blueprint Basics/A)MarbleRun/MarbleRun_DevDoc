 Marble Run Documentation HERE 


"By hijacking the camera control through LEVEL ON PLAY I can create a static scene"
"I didn't use "Engine" "Engine - Inputs" I used a level blueprint !

Find ^ that stuff here on MarbleRun LevelBluePrint:

BIG Lesson Learned : Select things in the editor world and then 
going into a blueprint to create a reference to the object. Though this 
cannot be done for everything sometimes it's better to be all strucutal and make
various classes and such.

Yeah I didnâ€™t comment these blueprints but I do have documentation
Git (here)
